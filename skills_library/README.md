# Skills Library

This directory contains detailed installation guides for skills that Gemini can install for users.

Each skill has its own folder with an `INSTALL.md` file containing step-by-step instructions.

## Available Skills

| Skill | Description | Folder |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| WhatsApp | Read/send WhatsApp messages via whatsmeow MCP | `whatsapp/` |

## How It Works

When a user requests a new capability (e.g., "connect my WhatsApp"), Gemini should:

1. **Check this library first** for an existing installation guide
2. Follow the `INSTALL.md` step-by-step
3. Only improvise if no guide exists here
